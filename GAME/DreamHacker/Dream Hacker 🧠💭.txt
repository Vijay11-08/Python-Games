==>Key Features & Implementation Plan

- Dream Entry System – Different dream levels based on people's subconscious thoughts.
- Dream Physics – Floating islands, cyberpunk cities, zero gravity, etc.
- Memory Editing – Solve puzzles to extract, alter, or protect secrets.
- Subconscious Monsters – AI-controlled enemies that chase and attack players.
- Dream Codes – Players must decrypt codes to unlock hidden memories.
- Avoid Waking the Host – Actions should not cause too much disturbance or the dream collapses.
- Multiple Endings – Choices affect how the dream world and real world change.


Step-by-Step Implementation

1️⃣ Game Setup
Use Pygame for graphics, movement, and animations.
Load different dream levels (floating islands, cyberpunk world, etc.).
Implement a player character with movement abilities.

2️⃣ Dream Physics
Modify gravity in different dream levels (floating, slow motion, reverse physics).
Randomly shifting platforms in some levels.
Use Box2D (Pymunk or Pygame physics engine) to create physics-based interactions.

3️⃣ Memory Editing Mechanic
Implement puzzle-solving elements (drag-and-drop pieces, typing codes).
Create memory fragments that need to be found and reassembled.
Allow players to alter key memories, which affects the game's ending.

4️⃣ Subconscious Monsters (AI Enemies)
AI patrols and chases the player when detected.
Enemies have different behaviors (some stalk, some rush, some hide in shadows).
Implement stealth mechanics (hiding in objects, freezing to avoid detection).

5️⃣ Dream Codes (Puzzles)
Create a system where players decrypt codes to access memories.
Use randomized password mechanics or symbol matching mini-games.

6️⃣ Avoid Waking the Host
A "disturbance meter" increases when the player makes noise.
If it reaches 100%, the dream collapses and the player loses.
Players must move carefully and solve puzzles without alarming the dreamer.

Features Implemented in This Code
✅ Dream Environment – Dark mysterious world with hidden memory pieces.
✅ AI Subconscious Monsters – Enemies chase the player when detected.
✅ Memory Collection – Collect 3 hidden fragments to unlock a secret.
✅ Stealth & Disturbance Meter – Players must move carefully to avoid waking the host.
✅ Win & Lose Conditions – Win if all memories are collected, lose if the disturbance meter hits 100%.

Next Steps to Improve
🔹 Different Dream Worlds – Floating islands, futuristic cities, glitchy dreamscapes.
🔹 Hacking Mini-Games – Solve puzzles to decrypt dream codes.
🔹 Multiple Endings – Choices change how the dreamer’s real life is affected.
🔹 Power-ups – Items to lower disturbance or distract monsters.
