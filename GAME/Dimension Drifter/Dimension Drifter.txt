"Dimension Drifter 🌌🔮"

🧐 What’s the Game About?
You play as a scientist who accidentally activates an unstable portal, transporting you into parallel dimensions! Each universe follows different physical rules, and your goal is to collect energy shards to repair the portal and return home—before you’re lost forever!

🌟 Core Concept (What Makes It Unique?)

Unlike normal platformers or puzzle games, Dimension Drifter introduces:
🔹 Reality Shifting Mechanics – Every level has unique physics (low gravity, inverted time, or liquid terrain).
🔹 Multiverse Travel – Explore ancient ruins, futuristic cities, or worlds ruled by AI!
🔹 Dimension Anomalies – Some dimensions are safe, but others have glitches, collapsing zones, or cosmic storms.
🔹 Adaptive Gameplay – Your decisions change the timeline, unlocking alternate endings!

🎮 Gameplay & Features

⚡ Unlock New Abilities: Each dimension grants special powers like phasing through walls, reversing gravity, or splitting into clones.
🤯 Puzzle-Platforming Challenges: Solve physics-based puzzles using your abilities!
👾 Enemy Encounters: Avoid shadow creatures, rogue robots, or ancient guardians who don’t want you escaping!
🔧 Upgrade Your Gear: Enhance your portal device, hacking tools, and shield generator.
🏆 How Do You Win?


To escape, you must:
✔️ Find energy shards hidden in different dimensions.
✔️ Solve dimensional puzzles to restore the portal’s stability.
✔️ Avoid paradoxes—too many timeline changes can cause a multiverse collapse!
✔️ Make the final jump back home before time runs out!
