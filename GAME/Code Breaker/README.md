# 🎮 Code Breaker - The Ultimate Puzzle Challenge 🔐  

## 🧠 Game Concept  
**"Code Breaker"** is an exciting logic-based puzzle game where players must crack a secret code using hints! Sharpen your problem-solving skills while enjoying a fun and brain-teasing challenge!  

## 🕹️ How It Works  
- The game generates a **4-digit secret code** 🔢  
- Players enter their best guess and receive **color-coded hints** 🎨  
  - 🟩 **(Green)** - Correct number **in the correct position** ✅  
  - 🟨 **(Yellow)** - Correct number **but in the wrong position** 🔄  
  - 🔴 **(Red)** - Number is **not in the secret code** ❌  
- Use logic and strategy to **decode the number before running out of attempts!** 🎯  

## 🎯 Game Levels  
🔥 **Easy Mode** – 3-digit codes, **unlimited** attempts 😎  
⚡ **Medium Mode** – 4-digit codes, **10** attempts 🏆  
💀 **Hard Mode** – 5-digit codes, **7** attempts with fewer hints 💡  
👑 **Master Mode** – Guess **a secret word** instead of numbers! 🄤  

## 🛠️ Features  
✔️ **Interactive UI** – Built using `tkinter` for a smooth experience 🖥️  
✔️ **Timed Challenges** – Solve under pressure ⏳  
✔️ **Leaderboard** – Track **high scores & best times** 🏅  
✔️ **Multiplayer Mode** – Take turns setting and guessing codes 👥  
✔️ **Randomized Codes** – Ensures unique puzzles every time 🎲
